  - `calculatePerformanceMetrics()`: Computes response time percentiles

### 3. React Hooks

#### Message Processing Hook (`src/hooks/useMessageProcessing.ts`)
- **Features:**
  - React integration for message processing
  - State management for processing status
  - Progress tracking and error handling

- **Features:**
  - Model information management
  - Custom pricing configuration
  - Model search and filtering
  - Provider-based organization
  - Persistent storage integration

#### Enhanced Type Definitions
- **Added Types:**
  - `MessageProcessingOptions` and `MessageProcessingResult`

- Automatic token counting for input/output
- Real-time cost calculation based on model pricing
- Support for custom pricing configurations
- Per-message and session-level cost tracking

### 3. Real-Time Statistics Display
- Live updating statistics during conversations
- Session-specific metrics (tokens, cost, response time)
- Performance indicators (tokens/second, error rates)
- Visual progress indicators and activity tracking

### 4. Retry Functionality
- Automatic retry for failed messages
- Configurable retry attempts (max 3)
- Exponential backoff delay
- Retry attempt tracking and display
- User-initiated retry with confirmation

### 5. Enhanced User Experience
- Processing status indicators
- Progress bars during message processing
- Real-time token and cost estimates
- Error messages with actionable retry options
- Responsive UI updates during processing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Service Layer Separation**: Message processing and statistics are handled in dedicated services, separate from UI components
2. **React Hooks Pattern**: Custom hooks provide clean integration between services and React components
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Statistics auto-refresh with configurable intervals to provide live feedback
4. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly retry mechanisms
5. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and debounced updates to prevent excessive API calls

### Integration Points
- **Chat Store**: Enhanced with streaming support and statistics tracking
- **OpenAI API Client**: Extended with streaming and concurrent request management
- **Storage System**: Persistent storage for model information and pricing
- **File Processing**: Integration with existing file attachment system

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Network Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **API Errors**: User-friendly error messages with retry options
- **Validation Errors**: Input validation with helpful feedback
- **Processing Errors**: Graceful degradation with error recovery

## Testing and Validation

### Test Component
Created `MessageProcessingTest.tsx` for manual testing of:
- Message sending with streaming
- Token counting accuracy
- Cost calculation
- Retry functionality
- Error handling
- Progress tracking

### Build Verification
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Proper type safety maintained
- No runtime errors in basic functionality
- Successful Vite build with optimized bundles
